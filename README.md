What is this?
-------------

BareMetal is a _very_ lean kernel. The name is a play on the phrase "bare metal" which means to run your OS or application directly on hardware (without a virtualization layer). BareMetal also only offers the "bare essentials" required for a working operating system.

BareMetal provides basic hardware support for network and disk access via a low-level abstraction layer.
